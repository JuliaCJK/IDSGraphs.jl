# Internal Functions & Structs

Note: any objects here are **not** part of the public API and are subject to change at any time. You should not rely on any of these functions remaining the same across versions.


## Structure Parsing

An explicit stack of characters is parsed to form a tree structure of `AbstractCharStructure` structs. This makes it easier to process and validate.
