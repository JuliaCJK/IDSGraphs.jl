# IDSGraphs.jl Documentation

This is a convenience package for reading and processing IDS files, which represent decompositions of CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) language characters. Functionality is provided for reading IDS files, and representing and operating on them as character component graphs.

Still in early development! APIs have yet to be finalized, more basic features will be added, tests are currently non-existent, and documentation is sparse. Development is ongoing.
